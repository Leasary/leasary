                <p>Easily list your property and create rental applications specific to your requirements. Cross post
                    your property and application to other property listing sites.</p>
                <p>Instantly generate contracts specific to your property and itâ€™s requirements. Send the lease over to
                    the potential tenant electronically for an immediate signature.</p>
                <p>Keep tabs on the tenant with our app. Monitor expiring leases, unhappy tenants and rent payments all
                    in one place.</p>

                <h2>Payments</h2>

                <p>Low-fee payment of rent and other property bills. Manage rent and other utility sharing programs
                    across multiple tenants and multiple units.</p>

                <p>Automatically generate an interest-bearing security deposit account that the properties deposit goes
                    into. Automatically pay back out returned security deposit at the end of the lease once a
                    walkthrough has been completed.</p>

                <h2>Maintenance</h2>

                <p>Tenants can submit maintenance requests, and landlords can manage their progress as they fix the
                    issue. Keep a detailed inventory of property equipment, and schedule preventative maintenance.</p>

                <p>Instantly contract out the request to local trusted vendors. Setup annual maintenance like air filter
                    replacements or hedge trimming.</p>
